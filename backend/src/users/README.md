# UserService (users.service.ts)

## Purpose: Acts as the intermediary between the database (through TypeORM) and the application's controllers. It contains the business logic to manage users, such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting user records.

## Key Components:

@InjectRepository(User): This decorator injects the User repository into the service, allowing you to perform various operations on the User entity.
findAll(): An example method that retrieves all user records from the database. You can add more methods to perform other CRUD operations.

# UserController (users.controller.ts)

## Purpose: Handles incoming HTTP requests related to users and delegates them to the UserService for processing. It defines the endpoints for user-related actions, such as fetching all users.

## Key Components:

@Controller('users'): This decorator marks the class as a route handler, prefixing all routes defined in the controller with /users.

@Get(): This decorator sets up a GET request handler for the route. When the /users endpoint is hit with a GET request, the findAll() method is called.
findAll(): Calls the findAll() method from the UserService to fetch all users.

# UsersModule (users.module.ts)

## Purpose: Organizes the user-related components (controller and service) and the User entity into a single module. This encapsulation makes the module easily importable into other parts of the application.

## Key Components:

TypeOrmModule.forFeature([User]): Specifies that the module uses the User entity. This makes the User repository available to be injected into other providers like UserService.

controllers: [UserController]: Registers the UserController to handle requests.

providers: [UserService]: Registers the UserService to be used within the module.

# AppModule Update

## Purpose: Serves as the root module of your NestJS application. It's updated to include the UsersModule, effectively integrating the user management functionality into the application.

## Key Components:

imports: [UsersModule]: This includes the UsersModule in the root module, making its routes and services part of the application.
